Description: 

*Have you been wondering how one smells the aromas of blueberries or chocolate in wine? Are you surprised when a sommelier points out the region or the vintage of a glass of wine after a blind tasting?*

We will gather to speak about the Secrets of Blind Tasting with Şeyma Baş, who is a jury member at international wine competitions and a Master of Wine Student. During this atelier, we will learn the steps of wine tasting and discover what a glass of wine actually tells us. 

We will taste five different wines during the workshop accompanied with a cheese plate.

Time: 15 July 2017, 7 pm - 9 pm
